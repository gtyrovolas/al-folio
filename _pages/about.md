Hi! I’m Giannis and welcome to my personal website. I’m a DPhil student in Computer Science at the University of Oxford supported by an EPSRC scholarship. I have the pleasure of being supervised by Prof. Paul Goldberg and Dr. Alexandros Hollender. My research is in Algorithmic Game Theory and more specifically in fair and truthful mechanisms. I also teach at University College as a Non-Stipendiary Lecturer.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer for Optiver. I completed my Master's at the University of Oxford in Mathematics and Computer Science. My thesis was on Liquid Democracy which was supervised by Prof. Edith Elkind and published in AAAI 2024.

When I’m not studying I enjoy reading, watching classic films and playing story-driven videogames.
